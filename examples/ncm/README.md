# PFPG for NCM Problems

The example compares three methods to solve the NCM problems: Grad, PFPG, and
Newton.

Currently the Newton solver **is not shipped** along with the PFOpt distribution.
The source code is avaiable at [here](http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~matsundf/CorrelationMatrix.m). One can use `install_newton.m` to download the code.
```
>> install_newton
```

**The official link appears to be invalid (2019.4.23)**. The Newton solver
will be skipped if `CorrelationMatrix.m` is missing in the current directory.
